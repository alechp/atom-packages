## Customize CSS
<kbd>cmd-shift-p</kbd> then run `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Customize Css` command to open `style.less` file, then add and modify the following lines:

```less
.markdown-preview.markdown-preview {
  &.prince {
    // your prince css here
  }
}
```

For example, to change the page size to `A4 landscape`:
```less
.markdown-preview.markdown-preview {
  &.prince {
    @page {
      size: A4 landscape
    }
  }
}
```

More information can be found at [prince user guide](https://www.princexml.com/doc/).
Especially [page styles](https://www.princexml.com/doc/paged/#page-styles).

## Export on save
Add the front-matter like below:
```yaml
---
export_on_save:
  prince: true
---
```
So the PDF file will be generated every time you save your markdown source file.
