# Beamer Document
## Overview
To create a Beamer presentation from **Markdown Preview Enhanced**, you specify the `beamer_presentation` output format in the front-matter of your document.  
You can create a slide show broken up into sections by using the `#` and `##` heading tags (you can also create a new slide without a header using a horizontal rule (`----`).  
For example here’s a simple slide show:  
```markdown
---
title: "Habits"
author: John Doe
date: March 22, 2005
output: beamer_presentation
---

# In the morning

## Getting up

- Turn off alarm
- Get out of bed

## Breakfast

- Eat eggs
- Drink coffee

# In the evening

## Dinner

- Eat spaghetti
- Drink wine

----

## Going to sleep

- Get in bed
- Count sheep
```  

## Export Path  
You can define the document export path by specifying `path` option. For example:    

```yaml
---
title: "Habits"
output:
  beamer_presentation:
    path: /Exports/Habits.pdf
---
```   
If `path` is not defined, then document will be generated under the same directory.

## Incremental Bullets
You can render bullets incrementally by adding the `incremental` option:
```yaml
---
output:
  beamer_presentation:
    incremental: true
---
```
If you want to render bullets incrementally for some slides but not others you can use this syntax:
```markdown
> - Eat eggs
> - Drink coffee
```

## Themes
You can specify Beamer themes using the `theme`, `colortheme`, and `fonttheme` options:  
```yaml
---
output:
  beamer_presentation:
    theme: "AnnArbor"
    colortheme: "dolphin"
    fonttheme: "structurebold"
---
```

## Table of Contents
The `toc` option specifies that a table of contents should be included at the beginning of the presentation (only level 1 headers will be included in the table of contents). For example:
```yaml
---
output:
  beamer_presentation:
    toc: true
---
```

## Slide Level
The `slide_level` option defines the heading level that defines individual slides. By default this is the highest header level in the hierarchy that is followed immediately by content, and not another header, somewhere in the document. This default can be overridden by specifying an explicit `slide_level`:
```yaml
---
output:
  beamer_presentation:
    slide_level: 2
---
```

## Syntax Highlighting
The `highlight` option specifies the syntax highlighting style. Supported styles include “default”, “tango”, “pygments”, “kate”, “monochrome”, “espresso”, “zenburn”, and “haddock” (specify null to prevent syntax highlighting):  

For example:
```yaml
---
title: "Habits"
output:
  beamer_presentation:
    highlight: tango
---
```

## Pandoc Arguments   
If there are pandoc features you want to use that lack equivalents in the YAML options described above you can still use them by passing custom `pandoc_args`. For example:  
```yaml
---
title: "Habits"
output:
  beamer_presentation:
    pandoc_args: [
      "--no-tex-ligatures"
    ]
---
```

## Shared Options
If you want to specify a set of default options to be shared by multiple documents within a directory you can include a file named `_output.yaml` within the directory. Note that no YAML delimeters or enclosing output object are used in this file. For example:    

**_output.yaml**
```yaml
beamer_presentation:
  toc: true
```
All documents located in the same directory as `_output.yaml` will inherit it’s options. Options defined explicitly within documents will override those specified in the shared options file.
