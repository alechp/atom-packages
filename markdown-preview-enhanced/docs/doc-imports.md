## How to use?  
just  

    @import "your_file"  

easy, right :)

## Refresh button  
Refresh button is now added at the right corner of preview.  
Clicking it will clear file caches and refresh the preview.  
It could be useful if you want to clear image cache. [#144](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/issues/144) [#249](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/issues/249)
