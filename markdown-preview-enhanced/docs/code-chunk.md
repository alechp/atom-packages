# Code Chunk (Beta)  
**Changes might happen in the future.**  
To enable code chunk highlighting, install [language-gfm-enhanced](https://atom.io/packages/language-gfm-enhanced) package and disable the `language-gfm` package.    

**Markdown Preview Enhanced** allows you to render code output into documents.     

    ```{bash}
    ls .
    ```

    ```{javascript cmd:"node"}
    var date = Date.now()
    console.log(date.toString())
    ```   

**Here is a  [demo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/f83acb43/test/code-chunks-test.html), and its [raw file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/master/test/code-chunks-test.md).**  

## Commands & Keyboard Shortcust
* `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Run Code Chunk` or <kbd>shift-enter</kbd>      
execute single code chunk where your cursor is at.    
* `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Run All Code Chunks` or <kbd>ctrl-shift-enter</kbd>   
execute all code chunks.    

## Format
You can configure code chunk options in format of `{lang  opt1:value1, opt2:value2, ...}`    

**lang**  
The grammar that the code block should highlight.  
It should be put at the most front.  

## Options
**cmd**    
The command to run.  
If `cmd` is not provided, then `lang` will be regarded as command.    

eg:  

		```{python cmd:"/usr/local/bin/python3"}
		print("This will run python3 program")
		```


**output**  
`html`, `markdown`, `text`, `png`, `none`  

Defines how to render code output.   
`html` will append output as html.    
`markdown` will parse output as markdown. (MathJax and graphs will not be supported in this case, but KaTeX works)      
`text` will append output to a `pre` block.    
`png` will append output as `base64` image.  
`none` will hide the output.  

eg:     

    ```{gnuplot output:"html"}
    set terminal svg
    set title "Simple Plots" font ",20"
    set key left box
    set samples 50
    set style data points

    plot [-10:10] sin(x),atan(x),cos(atan(x))
    ```

**args**  
args that append to command. eg:    

    ```{python args:["-v"]}
    print("Verbose will be printed first")
    ```

    ```{erd args:["-f", "svg", "-i"], output:"html"}
		# output svg format and append as html result.
    ```

**stdin**  
If `stdin` is set to true, then the code will be passed as stdin instead of as file.

**hide**  
`hide` will hide code chunk but only leave the output visible. default: `false`  
eg:

    ```{python hide:true}
    print('you can see this output message, but not this code')
    ```

**continue**  
If set `continue: true`, then this code chunk will continue from the last code chunk.  
If set `continue: id`, then this code chunk will continue from the code chunk of id.  
eg:    

	```{python id:"izdlk700"}
	x = 1
	```

	```{python id:"izdlkdim"}
	x = 2
	```

	```{python continue:"izdlk700", id:"izdlkhso"}
	print(x) # will print 1
	```

**matplotlib**  
If set `matplotlib: true`, then the python code chunk will plot graphs inline in the preview.    
eg:    

	```{python matplotlib:true, id:"izbp0zt9"}
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	plt.plot([1,2,3, 4])
	plt.show() # show figure
	```

**element**  
The element that you want to append after.  
Please check this [demo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/f83acb43/test/code-chunks-test.html).

**require**  
The javascript files that you want to require. Works the same as html `<script src="{js_file_path}"></script>`.  
Please check this [demo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/f83acb43/test/code-chunks-test.html).  

**id**  
`id` will be automatically generated to track the running result.  
Please **Do Not** modify it. If you modify it, please make sure it is unique in your markdown file.    

## Macro
* **input_file**  
`input_file` is automatically generated under the same directory of your markdown file and will be deleted after running code that is copied to `input_file`.      
By default, it is appended at the very end of program arguments.  
However, you can set the position of `input_file` in your `args` option by `{input_file}` macro. eg:  

<pre>
```{program args:["-i", "{input_file}", "-o", "./output.png"]}
...your code here
```
</pre>

## Demo
This demo shows you how to render entity-relation diagram by using [erd](https://github.com/BurntSushi/erd) library.   

    ```{erd output:"html", args:["-i", "{input_file}", "-f", "svg"], id:"ithhv4z4"}

    [Person]
    *name
    height
    weight
    +birth_location_id

    [Location]
    *id
    city
    state
    country

    Person *--1 Location
    ```

`{erd output:"html", args:["-i", "{input_file}", "-f", "svg"], id:"ithhv4z4"}`  
* `erd` the program that we are using. (*you need to have the program installed first*)  
* `output:"html"` we will append the running result as `html`.  
* `args` field shows the arguments that we will use.  
* `id` is a unique identifier automatically generated, you don't need to care about it.  

Then we can click the `run` button at the preview to run our code.

## Limitations
* Doesn't work with `ebook` yet.  
* Might be buggy when using`pandoc document export`
