# Pandoc (beta)
After version `0.8.4`, **Markdown Preview Enhanced** supports `pandoc document export` feature that works similarly to `RStudio Markdown`.   
To use this feature, you need to have [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) installed.   
Installation instruction of pandoc can be found [here](http://pandoc.org/installing.html).  
You can use `pandoc document export` by right clicking at the preview, then you will see it on the context menu.

## Pandoc Parser
By default **Markdown Preview Enhanced** uses [remarkable](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/remarkable) to parse markdown.  
You can also set it to `pandoc` parser from package settings.

You can also set pandoc arguments for individual files by writing front-matter   
```markdown
---
pandoc_args: ['--toc', '--toc-depth=2']
---
```

Please note that `--filter=pandoc-citeproc` will be automatically added if there is `references` or `bibliography` in your front-matter.    

**Attention**: This feature is still experimental. Feel free to post issues or suggestions.    
**Known Issues & Limitations**:  
1. `Live Update` will be disabled if `Use Pandoc Parser` is checked. The preview will only be updated when you save the file.  
2. `Presentation` will not be working with `pandoc parser`.  
3. `Scroll sync` is less accurate and has bugs sometimes.  
4. `ebook` export has problem.  
5. `Code Chunk` is sometimes buggy.  
6. `Create TOC` command doesn't work, but `[TOC]` works.  

## Front-Matter   
`pandoc document export` requires writing `front-matter`.  
more information and tutorial about how to write `front-matter` can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).
