## How to use?  
just  

`@import "your_file"`

easy, right :)

`<!-- @import "your_file" -->` is also valid.   

## Refresh button  
Refresh button is now added at the right corner of preview.  
Clicking it will clear file caches and refresh the preview.  
It could be useful if you want to clear image cache. [#144](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/issues/144) [#249](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/issues/249)

## Import online files
For example:

## Import PDF file  
To import PDF file, you need to have [pdf2svg](extra.md) installed.

However, it is not recommended to import large PDF files.  
For example:

@import "test.pdf"
```

Display the `nth` page of PDF. 1-based indexing. For example `{page_no=1}` will display the 1st page of pdf.  
* **page_begin**, **page_end**  
Inclusive. For example `{page_begin=2 page_end=4}` will display the number 2, 3, 4 pages.

## Force to render as Code Block  
```markdown
@import "test.puml" {code_block=true class="line-numbers"}
@import "test.py" {class="line-numbers"}
```

## As Code Block
