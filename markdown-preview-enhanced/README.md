## How it works
- [remarkable](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/remarkable) to convert markdown to html.
- [KaTeX](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX) or [MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax) to render math expressions. ([KaTeX Supported functions/symbols](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX/wiki/Function-Support-in-KaTeX)) (MathJax is incompatible with `preview-inline` package)
  - expression within `$...$` or `\(...\)` will be rendered normally.  
  - expression within `$$...$$` or `\[...\]` and code block <code>\`\`\`math</code> will be rendered in displayMode.   
  - if you want to enable math highlighting, try [language-gfm-enhanced](https://atom.io/packages/language-gfm-enhanced) package.  
  - You can choose your math rendering method from [settings panel](#settings-panel).   
		**MathJax** supports more symbols, but it has slower rendering speed compared to **KaTeX**.

- [mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid) to render flowchart and sequence diagram.  
	- code block with `mermaid` (or `@mermaid`) notation will be rendered by [mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid)  
	- check [mermaid doc](http://knsv.github.io/mermaid/#flowcharts-basic-syntax) for more information about how to create flowchart and sequence diagram

- [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/) to create multiple kinds of graph. (**Java** is required)  
	- You can install [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) (not required) to generate all diagram types.
	- code block with `puml` or `plantuml` or (`@puml` or `@plantuml`) notation will be rendered by [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/).  
- [WaveDrom](http://wavedrom.com/) to create digital timing diagram.  
	- code block with `wavedrom` (or `@wavedrom`) notation will be rendered by [wavedrom](https://github.com/drom/wavedrom).
- [Viz.js](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js) to render [dot language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) graph.  
	- code block with `viz` (or `@viz`) notation will be rendered by [Viz.js](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js).
    - add `engine:[engine_name]` at the first line of code block to choose different render engine. For example `engine:dot`. Engine `circo`, `dot`, `neato`, `osage`, or `twopi` are supported. Default engine is `dot`.   
- [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) to render beautiful presentations.

## FAQ
1. **I am not able to find this package in atom?**  
Please search for the full name of this package. `markdown-preview-enhanced`  
2. **I exported a html file, and I want to deploy it on my own remote server. But math typesetting (MathJax or KaTeX) doesn't work, what should I do?**  
Please make sure you have `Use CDN hosted resources` checked when exporting.  
3. **I exported a presentation html file, and I want to put it on my Github Page or deploy remotely?**  
Please check the last question.  
4. **How do I get dark style preview?**  
If you want the style of the preview to be consistent with your atom editor, go to settings of this package, then change the `Preview Theme`.  
Or you can run `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Customize Css` command, then modify the `style.less` file.  [#68](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/issues/68), [#89](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/issues/89).
5. **The preview is super super lagging?**  
This might happen when your markdown file is too big, or you are using too many math or graphs.  
Therefore I would like to recommend you to disable `Live Update` functionality.  
You can run `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Toggle Live Update` to disable it.  
6. **Do you need a job? (Huh... is this question really related to FAQ???)**  
Yes, I am looking for job. `(*/ω＼*)` (Any country (region) should be fine for me. I can also work remotely.)     
I am an international student from China currently studying at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am a CS major student and I will get my BS/MCS degree this May (2017).  
I am personally very interested in game development and front-end web development. If you are willing to offer me a job opportunity, please contact me by my school email `ywang189@illinois.edu` or my personal email `shd101wyy@(sina|gmail).com`. (plz don't be mad if you don't get any response from me because I might be busy working on my homework `(✿◡‿◡)).      
Thank you very much :)
